## What is a Firewall ?

Imagine your computer or server is like a house. A firewall is like a security guard standing at the front gate (your network connection) of your house. The job of the security guard is to decide which people (data) are allowed into your house and which ones should stay out. The security guard uses rules (or instructions) to make these decisions.

For example:

  * The guard might let in people carrying packages from the post office (web traffic, email).
  
  * But, the guard might stop suspicious people (bad data, hackers) trying to sneak in.
